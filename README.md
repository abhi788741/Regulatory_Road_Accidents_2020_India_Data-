# 🚦 Regulatory Affairs of Road Accident Data – India (2020)

This project analyzes the **2020 Road Accident Dataset of India** to uncover accident patterns, contributing factors, and policy-driven insights for improved road safety.  
The work was carried out as part of my collaboration with **Unified Mentors Private Limited**.

## 📊 Project Overview
Road accidents remain a critical challenge in India, affecting lives and infrastructure.  
Through this project, I applied **data analytics techniques** to explore accident data from major Indian cities and identify actionable patterns.

**Objectives:**
- Identify accident-prone cities and regions  
- Analyze the impact of traffic control, weather on accidents  
- Displayed Cause of Accidents by categories and subcategories
- Certain cities show a higher fatality ratio compared to total accidents, indicating weaker infrastructure or emergency response. 
- Suggest insights for regulatory and policy improvements  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
